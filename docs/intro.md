# MLOps & LLMOps Crash Course

> **"A model's quality or usefulness does not remain static after deployment. The real world changes."**

Welcome to this comprehensive crash course on **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** and **Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps)**. This guide will take you from the fundamentals of deploying ML models to production-ready systems at scale.

## What You'll Learn

This course covers the complete lifecycle of production ML systems:

### Part I: Foundations (Chapters 1-4)
- MLOps fundamentals and system-level concerns
- ML pipelines and workflow orchestration
- End-to-end ML systems architecture
- Data validation and quality

### Part II: Data & Features (Chapters 5-7)
- Feature engineering and feature stores
- Data versioning and lineage
- Feature pipelines at scale

### Part III: Training & Experimentation (Chapters 8-10)
- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Distributed training strategies

### Part IV: Deployment & Serving (Chapters 11-13)
- Model serving patterns and architectures
- Containerization and orchestration
- A/B testing and canary deployments

### Part V: Monitoring & Operations (Chapters 14-16)
- Model monitoring and observability
- Drift detection and alerting
- Continuous training and retraining

### Part VI: LLMOps (Chapters 17-18)
- LLM deployment and serving
- Prompt engineering and evaluation
- RAG systems and fine-tuning

## Prerequisites

This course assumes:
- Solid foundation in Python programming
- Understanding of probability theory
- Software engineering and testing practices
- Implementational understanding of ML algorithms

## Course Philosophy

> **Insight**
>
> The ML model or algorithm itself is only a small part of a production ML system. The vast surrounding infrastructure (data pipelines, configuration, automation, serving, monitoring) is much larger and more complex.

Let's begin your journey into production ML systems!
